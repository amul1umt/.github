## The platform comprises of four key repositories.  

* Edge AI Libraries provide a set of edge optimized, composable libraries, software development kits, and microservices to help you build performant, production-quality, multimodal edge AI applications, along with user-friendly workflows for optimizing and deploying them.  
* Edge AI Suites are curated set of building blocks along with industry specific libraries, sample applications, to help build optimized AI applications for specific industry use cases. There are 4 industry AI suites currently part of this – Retail, Manufacturing, Metro, and Media and Entertainment. 
* Edge Manageability Framework provides capabilities and building blocks for securely onboarding, provisioning, and management of edge devices and edge node software, along with orchestration of edge and AI applications and clusters at scale.  
* Edge Microvisor Toolkit is an edge optimized, low footprint, container host to enable you to take advantage of the latest Intel-silicon features for running modern AI workloads at the edge. 

Each of the above-mentioned repositories provide you with respective contribution guidelines as well as templates to report any issues. 

The repositories within the platform are primarily under Apache 2.0 license, unless otherwise specified within the respective repositories.
